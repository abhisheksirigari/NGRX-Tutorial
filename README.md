# Ngrx Tutorial

```javascript 

Create Angular application. You can use mockup to build simple template. 
Please apply some basic styles for this template (you can use Bootstrap 4).
Parts of application: header with title and subtitle, search input and list 
of Service Providers.

1)  Application has to be opened by localhost URL (without any port)
2)  All data has to be loaded from json and saved in store.
3)  Page_components.json stores information about page components 
    (header, search input and Service Providers list) 
4)  Inactive-service-providers.json stores information about inactive Service Providers. 
    This information has to be matched with info from page_components.json. Service Providers
    status has to be displayed inside Service Provider card (see mockup). 
5)  Search box has to filter Service Providers by name. Search starts by enter button click. 

```
